Notifications API
=================

This document covers the REST APIs for the notifications feature.

Notifications are created by the system or an admin and delivered to customers. Customers can retrieve their notifications and mark them as read.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All REST endpoints require a valid `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header.
> `POST /v1/notifications` requires a `super-admin` or `admin` user token.
> `GET /v1/notifications` requires a valid customer token and returns only that customer's notifications.
> `PATCH /v1/notifications/:uuid/read` accepts any valid authenticated token.
